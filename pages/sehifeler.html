     <h1 style="background-color: beige; color: coral; text-align: center;">About Jimmy Wales</h1>
     <p style="color: brown;">Jimmy Wales, born on August 7, 1966, in Huntsville, Alabama, is an American internet entrepreneur and co-founder of Wikipedia, one of the most influential and widely used online encyclopedias. Wales has played a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of digital knowledge and information sharing.

        Before co-founding Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales had a background in finance. He obtained a bachelor's degree in finance from Auburn University and later pursued a Ph.D. in finance, although he left the program to work in the realm of internet entrepreneurship. Wales's initial venture, a web portal called Bomis, provided adult content alongside search services and an online encyclopedia called Nupedia.
        
        It was during the Nupedia project that Wales collaborated with Larry Sanger, and the idea for a more open and collaborative platform emerged. This idea eventually led to the creation of Wikipedia in January 2001. Wikipedia's unique approach, allowing anyone to edit and contribute to articles, marked a departure from traditional encyclopedias and revolutionized the way information is created and shared.
        
        Wales has been an advocate for the principles of open access and the democratization of knowledge. He played a crucial role in the development of the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization that oversees Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects. As the co-founder and promoter of Wikipedia, Wales has been instrumental in building a global community of contributors dedicated to the free exchange of information.
        
        While Jimmy Wales is best known for his contributions to Wikipedia, he has been involved in various other ventures. He co-founded Wikia, a platform for collaborative content creation, and has been involved in initiatives related to online education and free access to information. Wales's work has earned him recognition and accolades, including being named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people.
        
        Wales's impact extends beyond the realm of technology and information. He has been an advocate for online freedom, privacy, and the protection of user rights. Through his various ventures and activities, Jimmy Wales continues to be a prominent figure in the digital space, contributing to the evolution of the internet and the way we access and contribute to information online.</p>
